Description:
Users can join the queue digitally from anywhere and receive a sequential token instantly.
Real-time tracking lets users see the current token being served and how many people are ahead of them.
Estimated waiting time is automatically calculated, so users know exactly how long they might have to wait.
A structured token swap system allows users to exchange positions fairly and transparently.
Admins get a powerful dashboard to monitor total waiting users, call the next token, and manage the queue smoothly.
The queue can be paused or resumed anytime, giving admins full operational control.
Queue limits and average waiting time are fully configurable for better crowd management.
Important announcements can be broadcast instantly to all users in the queue.
The entire system is secured with role-based authentication for both admins and users.
Built on a scalable backend architecture, the system is designed to grow across campuses, hospitals, banks, and public offices.
